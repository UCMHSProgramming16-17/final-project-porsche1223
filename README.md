Final Project - Intro to Programming 2016-2017

Setup:

Accept the invitation for the git repository
Clone to your computer
Create 'readme.md'
Commit and push - this way I can see who's having trouble setting up git
Activate your 'data' environment using source activate data
Overview:

Your final project is to visualize data using Python and Bokeh. You may use any data you wish, as long as it is appropriate for school. I will help with sample data.

Technical Skills Involved

Accessing an API and/or reading from a published dataset
Assessing data
Creating visualizations
Expectations

Visualizations are relevant and helpful in understanding data
Multiple visualizations should be present, unless a particularly challenging and informative individual visualization merits including only one
Your work should challenge you
Git is used appropriately
Deliverables

Python programs that created your visualizations (ie chart1.py, bargraph.py, or any other appropriately named python files)
Copies of your data
The visualizations created by your program
Process

Step 1 - Find Data

If you need help sourcing data, let me know. I can help

Step 2 - How are you planning to visualize the data?

Take a look around the Bokeh Gallery
In a file called vis-ideas.md, list some ideas for how you want to visualize your data
You won't necessarily get to all of them, but that's okay
Try to include some you might not necessarily know how to do yet
To create a bulleted list, use an asterisk at the start of the line, and have a blank line before the list
Step 3 - Start experimenting

You might want to start with some testing in interactive mode
You have examples in the .ipynb file I've included in this repo
The Bokeh User Guide and Bokeh Reference are very helpful
Remember imports. You might not need numpy, but you'll almost certainly need pandas

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
Importing bokeh will depend heavily on what you're doing with it

# For basic plotting of symbols
from bokeh.plotting import figure, output_file, save

# For Line charts
from bokeh.charts import Line, output_file, save
# If you want a different type of chart, replace Line with the type you want
To create a DataFrame named df from a csv file named data.csv:

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
To create a DataFrame named df2 from an excel file named datal.xls:

df2 = pd.read_excel('data1.xls')
